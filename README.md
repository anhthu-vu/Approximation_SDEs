# Approximation_SDEs
This repository contains the presentations and reports that I have done during my internship at the Institute of Mathematics, Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology. During this internship, I conducted a literature review on the weak and strong convergence rates of the Euler-Maruyama sheme for approximating the solutions of a class of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with HÃ¶lder-continous drifts.
